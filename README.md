I made this mess of a code purely with AI and vibe coding and a lot of pain and tears.
I will review the code and fix whatever mess this thing generated later.

For now, enjoy AI generated README stuff.

# Word Spaghetti

An interactive web-based word game where letters come alive and form connections as you type. Create words, watch them transform, and see what happens when you spell something meaningful!

## How It Works

1. **Type letters** on your keyboard to create floating letters on screen
2. **Form words** by typing sequentially - letters will try to connect
3. **Wait for validation** after you stop typing (1.5 seconds)
4. **Watch the magic** as valid words are recognized and celebrated
5. **Discover anagrams** - even jumbled letters can form valid words!

## Features

- **Interactive Physics**: Every letter behaves like a physical object you can push around
- **Word Recognition**: The game knows thousands of English words
- **Anagram Detection**: Type letters in any order, and the game will find valid words
- **Visual Effects**: Beautiful animations when words are discovered
- **Black Hole Effect**: Invalid words get dramatically consumed by a black hole
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback enhances the experience

## Controls

- **Type letters** to create particles
- **Mouse drag** to push letters around
- **Space** to add a space marker
- **ESC** or "Clear" button to reset the canvas
- **Toggle button** to collapse/expand instructions

## Technical Details

The game is built using vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. It features:

- Custom physics engine for letter interactions
- Dictionary lookup for word validation
